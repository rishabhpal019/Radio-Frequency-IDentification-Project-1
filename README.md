# Radio-Frequency-IDentification-Project-1

RFID is Radio Frequency Identification. It is an automated method of identification that utilizes non-contact wireless radio frequency signals wherein information is digitally embedded in RFID tags or smart labels which can be interpreted by radio signals by the reader. Data transmission happens between such a reader & movable object which can be detected and monitored. As information analysed from tags is stored in a database, RFID can be assumed equal to barcodes, or you can claim that the system that collects the data of the label retains data in the database.
