# Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a **Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)** system, which enables automatic identification of objects using radio waves. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and functional implementation of RFID-based identification, usable in applications like attendance systems, access control, inventory tracking, and more.

The system consists of an RFID reader module (such as the MFRC522), RFID tags/cards, and a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino). When a tag is brought near the reader, the system reads its unique identifier (UID) and processes it accordingly — for example, by logging it or triggering access permissions.

## What is RFID?

RFID is a wireless communication technology that uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system generally consists of:

- **Reader**: The device that emits radio signals and receives data from the tag.
- **Tag**: A small device that contains a microchip and antenna. Each tag has a unique identifier.
- **Controller**: A microcontroller or computer that processes data from the reader.

This technology is used widely in logistics, asset tracking, contactless payments, smart cards, and more.

## Project Features

- Detects RFID tags/cards in real-time
- Reads and displays UID from each tag
- Can be used as the base for access control or attendance systems
- Supports integration with databases or logs
- Simple, modular, and well-commented code for easy customization

## Hardware Required

- RFID Reader (e.g., MFRC522)
- RFID tags or cards (13.56 MHz)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino UNO, ESP32, STM32, etc.)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or soldered connections
- Power supply (USB or battery)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (if using Arduino)
- MFRC522 Library (for RC522 module)
- Serial Monitor (built into IDE) or external display (optional)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Connect the RFID module to the microcontroller.
3. Open the provided source code in your development environment (e.g., `rfid_reader.ino` for Arduino).
4. Upload the code to your microcontroller.
5. Open the serial monitor and scan a tag to see the UID printed in real-time.

## Example Use Cases

- Door access system: Allow/deny entry based on tag UID
- School attendance: Log students’ presence via RFID cards
- Smart library: Automatically register borrowed books
- Office login system: Track employee check-in/out times
